1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This table shows regional figures on the average consumption of energy (natural gas and electricity) of private dwellings broken down by type of dwelling and ownership for Nederland, group of provinces, provinces and municipalities. Besides, for total dwellings only, the share of heat distribution (district heating) has been added, because this is relevant for the interpretation of the height of the average consumption of natural gas.

Data available from: 2010

Status of the figures:
All figures from 2010 - 2021 are definite. Figures of 2022 are provisional.

Changes as of October 2023:
Provisional figures of 2022 have been added. Figures of 2021 have been updated.
The category “Average consumption of electricity” is replaced by “Average supply of electricity”
and a category “Average net supply of electricity” has been added.


When will new figures be published?
A revision to the method of this statistic is currently underway, causing the table to be delayed. New figures will come in the 3rd quarter of the folowing year.


2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:
Heat distribution:
a heating system, by which the houses in a neighbourhood are heated by an underground network of hot water pipes.

Explanation of symbols:

empty cell : not applicable 
. : data not available or not reliable or confidential
* : provisional figure
** : revised provisional figure (but not definite)

In this table an empty cell is also used for cells with value nill.

The figures of the average consumption of natural gas and the average consumption of electricity are rounded to ten numbers and listed at six or more dwellings by type of dwelling.

The share of district heating is indicated at ten or more (occupied) dwellings.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

The figures of natural gas and electricity used are derived of the connection records of the energy companies. These figures are linked by Statistics Netherlands to a number of registers, including a property register. By doing this, connections for private dwellings are identified and the break down by type of dwelling is made. Furthermore, a break down by type of ownership of the dwelling is made (owner-occupied or rented house).
The share of private dwellings connected to heat distribution (district heating) is calculated based on figures derived from Energie-Nederland. The amount of heat annual consumed by connected houses to heat distribution is not available.


The survey method for this table can be found in the survey description <a href='https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/methods/surveys/brief-survey-description/supply-of-electricity-and-natural-gas-via-the-national-grid'>Supply of electricity and natural gas via the national grid</a>.
